  story: `
On 28th February 2026, the Crossborder Outreach team visited Murang’a Rescue Centre to support vulnerable children through the donation of learning materials and basic logistical support.

The visit brought joy, encouragement, and hope to the children. For many, receiving simple items like exercise books and pens meant a chance to learn with confidence.

Through shared activities, conversations, and laughter, the team reminded the children that they are valued, supported, and not alone.

  impact: "Community support efforts helped raise awareness, encourage preparedness, and stand with families affected by the devastating Nairobi floods.",
  story: `
Heavy rains in Nairobi caused severe flooding that displaced families, damaged homes, and disrupted daily life across many neighborhoods.

During the crisis, communities came together to support one another, forming rescue chains, sharing resources, and helping stranded residents reach safety.

Crossborder Outreach used the moment to promote compassion, unity, and disaster preparedness, reminding communities that collective action and care can help rebuild hope even after disaster.

  quote: "Sometimes students don’t fail because they are incapable, but because they are silently struggling.",
  impact: "Mental health awareness initiatives help students feel heard, supported, and empowered to succeed beyond academic pressure.",
  story: `
Academic success is important, but mental wellbeing is just as critical for students.

Many young people silently struggle with stress, anxiety, and overwhelming expectations. Crossborder Outreach advocates for safe spaces where students can speak openly and receive guidance.

Through mentorship, awareness campaigns, and community dialogue, the mission encourages families and institutions to care about emotional wellbeing as much as academic achievement.
